# Ordo Aquilarum (Order of the Eagles)

Ordo Aquilarum is a Latin vocabulary quiz site created for my IB Computer Science internal assessment, but I am continuing development after the assignment anyways.

Ordo Aquilarum was created with Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

**NOTE: This site is still in development and is subject to change** 

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
